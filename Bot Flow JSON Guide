This guide will help you create a structured JSON file to drive the bot's flow. The bot operates using a JSON-based structure where each node represents a step in the conversation.
Their are 3 things that needed to be updated in order to run your json file: 
  First save you file in assets section with .json extension and add it under the assests section in pubspec.yaml file of the project. 
  Now just aupdate the fileName in main.dart with your specified file name and the bot is ready.

Just copy this prompt below and give to any GPT and create your own flow. 

# Node Types & Their Functions
1. Radio Nodes (Single Select Options)
  radioTypeWithAttachments: Options with individual attachments (video, images, audio).
  radioTypeWithTextOnly: Options share common images.
2. Checkbox Nodes (Multi-Select Options)
  checkbox: Each option is shown as a card with attachments (images/videos).
  checkboxInRowView: Same as checkbox, but with a “View More” button.
  checkboxInGridView: Displays options in a grid format with a “View More” button.
  Use checkboxInRowView or checkboxInGridView when there are too many attachments.
3. Multimedia Node
  multimedia: Allows the user to capture images, record audio, or record video.
4. Label Nodes (Bot Messages)
  label: Displays a message and moves automatically to the next step.
  labelWithNext: Displays a message, but the user must click "Next" to proceed.
5. Mandatory Node: "Load Bot"
  Every JSON must start with a "Load Bot" node that assigns the bot its core properties.

This is the format of the json file representing the use case of various nodes
{
  "Load Bot": {			// mandatory as it assigns the bot its properties
    "type": "Trip Planner Assistant",		// This text that will be shown on appbar
    "image": ["https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/cute-3d-robot-hand-hello-600nw-2299232587.jpg"],		// bot Image link
